This repository contains notes and excerpts from Scott Page's ___The Model Thinker___ (2018), Richard McElreath's ___Statistical Rethinking___, and other resources taken from Gelman et al's various writings.

The idea is to learn how combine statistical models with simple mathematical models that encode substantive knowledge about the problems at hand.

## Model Thinker

The `MT/` directory contains notes taken from Scott Page's book.

1. [**`Introduction.html`**](https://acastroaraujo.github.io/ModelThinker/MT/0-Introduction.html) includes notes from chapters 1-4 and a simulation of the Condorcet jury theorem in R, and then in Stan.

## Bayesian Data Analysis (BDA)

The `BDA/` directory contains related materials to Bayesian statistics, taken from either Richard McElreath's **Statistical Rethinking** or Andrew Gelman et al's **BDA3**.

1. [**`golf.html`**](https://acastroaraujo.github.io/ModelThinker/BDA/golf.html): This is the example that made me want to learn Bayesian Statistics in the first place.

2. [**`eight_schools.html`**](https://acastroaraujo.github.io/ModelThinker/BDA/eight_schools.html): Taken from BDA3.

    Some people think this example provides everything you need to know about Bayesian Statistics (see [here](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2014/01/21/everything-need-know-bayesian-statistics-learned-eight-schools/)).

To do...

- `cancer_rates.Rmd`: Taken from BDA3. This example discusses the pitfalls of ranking stuff and ignoring sample sizes. It is closely related to the `1-Distributions.Rmd` file.

- `multilevel_models.Rmd`

- `latent_space_models.Rmd`

- `adventures_in_covariance.Rmd`
