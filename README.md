# Model Thinker

This repository contains notes and excerpts from Scott Page's *The Model Thinker* (2018) and my attempts implement them in Stan. I provide additional references where necessary.

## Contents

- [`0-Introduction.md`](https://github.com/acastroaraujo/ModelThinker/blob/master/0-Introduction.md) includes notes from chapters 1-4 and a simulation of the Condorcet jury theorem in R, and then in Stan.

- `1-Distributions` includes notes from chapters 5-6.
